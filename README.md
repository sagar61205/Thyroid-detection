# Thyroid Detection
An ML based application which raised accuracy by 40% in identifying patient thyroid type compared to manual  clinical diagnosis.

A simple ML based website which predicts the thyroid type out of the 4 classes - "negative", "compensated hypothyroid", "primary hypothyroid", "secondary hypothyroid‚Äù using various thyroid tests such as 'TSH', 'T3', 'TT4' etc., where negative class means no thyroid related condition.

# Features:
<b>1. age</b> - Shows the age of the patient. <br/>
<b>2. sex</b> - Shows the gender of the patient. <br/>
<b>3. on_thyroxine</b> - Shows whether the patient is on Thyroxine treatment or not. <br/>
<b>4. query_on_thyroxine</b> - Shows whether the patient has raised any queries regarding their thyroxine treatment/hormone or not. <br/>
<b>5. on_antithyroid_medication</b> - Shows whether the patient is on antithyroid_medication or not. <br/>
<b>6. sick</b> - Shows whether the patient is sick or not. <br/>
<b>7. pregnant</b> - Shows whether the patient is pregnant or not. <br/>
<b>8. thyroid_surgery</b> - Shows whether the patient has gone through Thyroid surgery or not <br/>
<b>9. I131_treatment</b> - Shows whether the patient is going through Radioactive Iodine(I-131) treatment or not. <br/>
<b>10. query_hypothyroid</b> - Shows whether the patient has raised any query regarding hypothyroid or not. Hypothyroid means thyroid is less than the optimum amounts. <br/>
<b>11. query_hyperthyroid</b> - Shows whether the patient has raised any query regarding hyperthyroid or not. Hyperthyroid means thyroid is more than the optimum amounts. <br/>

<b>13. goitre</b> - Shows whether the patient is suffering from Goitre or not. <br/>
<b>14. tumor</b> - Shows whether the patient has any tumor or not. Tumor can either be benign or malignant. <br/>
<b>15. hypopituitary</b> - Shows whether the patient is on hypopituitary gland related treatment or not.
<b>16. psych</b> - Shows the patient's psych evaluation. <br/>
<b>17. TSH_measured</b> - Shows whether the thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>18. TSH</b> - If TSH has been measured then this columm shows the value of the TSH. <br/>
<b>19. T3_measured</b> - T3 is one of two major hormones made by your thyroid. Shows whether T3 of the patient has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>20. T3</b> - If T3 has been measured then this columm shows the value of the T3. <br/>
<b>21. TT4_measured</b> - T4 is another one of two major hormones made by your thyroid. Shows whether T4 of the patient has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>22. TT4</b> - If T3 has been measured then this columm shows the value of the T4. <br/>
<b>23. T4U_measured </b> - Shows whether T4U has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>24. T4U </b> - If measured, the value of the same. <br/>
<b>25. FTI_measured </b> - Shows Whether FTI(Free Thyroxine Index) for the patient has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>26. FTI</b> - If FTI has been measured then this columm shows the value of the FTI. <br/>
<b>27. TBG_measured</b> - Shows whether Thyroxine-Binding Globulin Deficiency has been measured or not. <br/>
<b>28. TBG</b> - If TBG is measured then it shows value of the same. <br/>
<b>29. referral_source</b> - Shows the organization/hospital from where the patient has been refferred. <br/>
<b>30. Class</b> - This is the Dependent feature. It consists of 4 classes 'negative', 'compensated hypothoroid', 'primary hypothoroid', 'secondary hypothoroid'. <br/>

This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, please don't use it for detecting Thyroid class type for a patient. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML into practice for healthcare sector.

## MOTIVATION üí™
Healthcare domain has a lot of issue and Thyroid is one of the glands which gets impacted by diseases and makes a large part of the polulation go for testing, medication and surgery for the treatment of Thyroid related disorders. This is a small and humble project which is using multiple datasets and merges those to create a model and predict the type of Thyroid condition the patient has namely; "negative", "compensated hypothyroid", "primary hypothyroid", "secondary hypothyroid‚Äù.
In this project, I present a website in which the predictions are implemented as; Batch File PRediction(which predicts and generates a new file with predicted values based in the pre-trained model. 
For the visibility predicting application, the user can input the data and the application will predict the class of Thyroid out of the 4 classes - "negative", "compensated hypothyroid", "primary hypothyroid", "secondary hypothyroid‚Äù.
