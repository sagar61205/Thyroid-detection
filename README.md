<h4>üìä The Business Problem:</h4>

Medical professionals faced significant challenges in accurately diagnosing thyroid disorders:
<ul><li>Manual diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and standard blood tests was time-consuming and prone to human error and subjectivity.</li><br>
<li>Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis could lead to incorrect treatment plans, affecting patient health outcomes.</li><br>
<li>The need for a decision-support system that could help doctors validate their initial assessments and reduce diagnostic errors.</li><br>    
</ul>

<h5>Thyroid types:</h5>

<h4>üìä My role and the solution:</h4>
As the Data Scientist on this project, I was tasked with building an AI-based classification tool to enhance diagnostic accuracy. I developed an end-to-end machine learning system that analyzes patient diagnostic metrics to predict potential thyroid disease, serving as a reliable second opinion for clinic doctors.
<br>

<h5>Key Objectives:</h5>
<ul><li>Analyze clinical patient data to identify key patterns indicative of thyroid conditions.</li><br>

<li>Build a highly accurate classification model that outperforms manual diagnosis methods.</li><br>

<li>Provide explainable AI insights to help doctors understand the model's predictions.</li><br>

<li>Deliver an accessible tool that integrates seamlessly into clinical workflow considerations.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Business Impact:</h4>
<ul>
<li>40% Improvement in diagnostic accuracy compared to manual clinical assessment methods.</li><br>
<li>10 % faster diagnosis reducing analysis time from hours to seconds.</li><br>
<li>Enhanced doctor Confidence through AI-powered decision support.</li><br>
<li>Explainable Predictions providing insights into contributing factors for each diagnosis.</li><br>
</ul>
